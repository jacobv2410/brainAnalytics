a demonstration of brain.js

This is a demonstration of how to use brain.js using a free data set on the factors of wine quality. It's real world usefullness is limited however, unless you happen to know the chemical content of whatever wine you're drinking. ;)

### Prerequisites

To start off with, you'll need to make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. If you don't, head to the [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) install page and download it with the default settings.

### Installing

Once you have node set up, navigate in the terminal to your intended folder and then download or clone this repo to that folder. Then, install the packages in the terminal.

```
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the file from the command line.

```
node ml.js
```

Mess around with the file and see what happens! What changes when you take away half the data set? 3/4 of the data set? What happens when you change the input? What happens when you switch the inputs and outputs? What parts of the ml.js code are you not farmiliar with? The best way to learn is by breaking something and fixing it! Google is our friend!

I hope this is a helpful demonstration and gives you a framework to mess around in and start discovering the incredible world of machine learning. If you have any questions or corrections let me know.
